# Background
This is one of my projects to showcase my progress in **SQL** and my improvement to modeling a database. I will be creating a database for a flight booking system.

### The modeling of a flight booking system:

1. Utilizing mysql built-in ER model creater.
2. Start with the basic tables like passenger,ticket & flight.
3. Normalizing the database by creating relationship between the tables
4. Creating seperate tables for data which I think will be redundant like airport
5. Reverse eigneering the model to create the database

# Tools I Used
- SQL

- MySQL

- Visual Studio Code

- Git & Github
# The ER model

# Conclusion

Overall, this project underscores the importance of SQL when creating a database. Not only did I enchance my SQL skills but I learned new skills along the way which will be detrimental for the career I am trying to pursuit .
