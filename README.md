# Introduction
**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a fundamental tool for accessing, managing, and analyzing data stored in relational databases. **SQL** provides a structured approach to querying and manipulating data, which is crucial for drawing meaningful insights from complex datasets.
 

# Background
This is one of my projects to showcase my progress in **SQL** and my improvement to modeling a database. I will be creating a database for a flight booking system. As I'm learning, I stumble upon amazing lecturers who give us projects such as these to helps us understand more about the topics we are learning.

### The modeling of a flight booking system:

1. Utilizing mysql built-in EER diagram.
2. Start with the basic tables like passengers, tickets & flights.
3. Add columns that align with the created tables.
4. Normalizing the database by creating relationship between the tables.
5. Creating seperate tables for data which I think will be redundant like airport.
6. Forward eigneering the model to create the database.
